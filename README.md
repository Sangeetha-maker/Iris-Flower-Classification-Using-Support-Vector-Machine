# Iris-Flower-Classification-Using-Support-Vector-Machine
This project applies Support Vector Machine (SVM) — a supervised machine learning algorithm — to classify iris flowers into three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica, based on four key features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.
